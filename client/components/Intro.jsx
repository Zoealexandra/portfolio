        <p>Initially I trained with a background in Information Systems and Accounting, and chose to retrain as a developer, to immerse myself in an industry that provided better challenges and growth. Iâ€™ve practically applied my knowledge during my time retraining at Enspiral Dev Academy, through a number of group projects, including a final project with a real-life application that has a positive social impact. People would describe me as driven and resilient, as well as hard-working and reliable.</p>
